**My Web Dev Learning Journey**  

**August 7 - Started my first web project**

I decided to dive in and build my first ever website using HTML and CSS! I sketched out a simple multi-page site called "Coding Kitchen" for sharing programming-themed food recipes. Today I setup my dev environment and coded the homepage with semantic tags like header, main, footer etc. Also added CSS stylesheet and added some basic formatting. Excited to see this idea taking shape!  

**August 8 - Fleshed out homepage content** 

Added more meaningful content to Coding Kitchen homepage today including navigation menu, hero banner with call-to-action button, and article placeholders. Styled buttons to change colors and create hover effects using CSS. Also watched videos on web design principles - very useful to make informed design choices from start.

**August 15 - Finalized core HTML & CSS templates**

My Coding Kitchen templates for homepage, recipes listing, individual recipe detail view and about page are now ready! Tested responsive behavior by previewing on multiple device sizes. As a beginner, I learned a lot about structuring page content properly using semantic HTML as well as cascading and inheritance in CSS.  

**August 22 - Built movie browsing app UI**

Started my second web project - MovieBrowser app to search and browse movies data. Focused on quickly assembling layout and UI components like navbar, search box, genre filter dropdowns, movie cards using the Bootstrap framework...

**August 29 - Added interactivity with JavaScript**

The MovieBrowser now has interactive features! I added JS event handlers so clicking search button or filters dynamically loads and displays movie data cards. Also created modal popup to showcase movie details on click...  

**September 5 - Planning CryptoPrice app in React**

Feeling confident to try building an app with React framework next. Came across idea of CryptoPrice app to display real-time crypto currency prices and market data. Will use Vite starter for fast setup. Sketched some component ideas - header, price cards, graphs etc. Excited to learn React principles!

**September 12 - Set up Vite dev environment**

Started off CryptoPrice app development by creating Vite project and installing React framework. Coded up reusable component functions for header, footer, crypto price cards that accept dynamic props. Understood how data flows down from parent to child elements in React.

Got it, here is an expanded version continuing the daily web dev journey until December 31st:

**September 19 - Integrated live crypto API data**

Implemented first integration in my CryptoPrice React app today by fetching live API data from CoinGecko. Created state hooks to store the data, and passed it to PriceCard components to display current rates dynamically. Also added graphs and charts from TradingView showcasing fluctuations.

**September 26 - Improved styling and UX** 

Improved the UI and UX of CryptoPrice app significantly this week. Added light and dark color themes with ability to toggle modes. Implemented framer-motion for smooth animated transitions. Categorized currencies and added search filtering. App is looking modern and professional now.

**October 3 - Contributed to company website project**  

Started my first collaboration project today, working with XYZ agency on their client ABC Company's website built in WordPress. I will be helping add dynamic components and conversion optimized pages to showcase their startup's products. My relevant React skills should come in handy!  

**October 17 - Created more CMS templates **

Now comfortable navigating ABC site's CMS dashboard. Added services, jobs and founder profile templates this week to round out their website content. Collaborated closely with project manager on structuring page sections. Understanding how custom frontend code integrates with backend CMS.  

**November 7 - Developed document management feature** 

To meet ABC's paperless office needs, this month I built a custom document management module using React that syncs with their WordPress media library seamlessly via REST API. Faced and overcame many technical hurdles on this problem solving experience integrating systems.

**November 21 - Migrated CMS to modern Jamstack**  

We decided to future-proof and optimize page loads by migrating the ABC website CMS from WordPress to GatsbyJS. I led development of templates using React components and sourcing data from headless WP via GraphQL. The Gatsby-powered site launched successfully delivering blazing fast performance!

**December 5 - Handed off features to internal team**

As external consultant on ABC's website project, I formally handed off all my implemented React modules and Gatsby architecture to their internal development team this week. I thoroughly documented features to ensure maintainability going forward. Feels great enabling their progress! 

**December 31 - 2022 Recap and Future Goals**   

As the year closes out, I reflect fondly on ramping up massively as a well-rounded front-end developer - from my humble static site beginnings to leveraging React for complex solutions. I was able to deliver impact through personal projects and professional work for clients. 2023 looks bright, maybe diving deeper into full-stack!
